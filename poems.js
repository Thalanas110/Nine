    title: "Whispers of Winter",
    author: "Emilia Frost",
    text: "Silent snow descends at dusk,\nCovering earth in crystal hush.\nBreath suspends in frozen air,\nWhite blanket draped without a care.\n\n\n\nFootprints vanish, time stands still,\nAs darkness climbs the distant hill.\nIn winter's grasp, the world now sleeps,\nWhile memory of autumn weeps."

    title: "Snow-Bound Heart",
    author: "Marcus Winter",
    text: "These frosted windows frame my days,\nAs winter's touch now longer stays.\nI watch the snowflakes dance and twirl,\nEach crystal perfect as they swirl.\n\nMy breath creates small clouds of white,\nThat dissipate from morning light.\nThe silence weighs like heavy snow,\nIn absence of your voice I know."

    title: "December's Memory",
    author: "Olivia Reid",
    text: "Remember when we walked the path,\nOur footsteps marking virgin snow?\nThe midnight hour, the stars above,\nThe world in silence down below.\n\nYour hand in mine, our breath entwined,\nTwo shadows cast by silver moon.\nDecember's chill could not compare\nTo warmth that left my heart too soon."

    title: "Frozen Bench",
    author: "Noah Blake",
    text: "The park bench waits in solitude,\nIts wooden slats with frost adorned.\nWhere once we sat in warmer days,\nNow empty space where hearts once warmed.\n\nI wonder if you think of me,\nWhen snowflakes touch your distant face.\nOr if I've melted from your mind,\nLike winter thaw leaves not a trace."

    title: "Snowfall at Midnight",
    author: "Sophia Chen",
    text: "The world transforms at midnight's hour,\nWhen snowflakes drift from skies above.\nThe city sleeps beneath the spell,\nOf winter's pure and gentle love.\n\nEach crystal brings a memory down,\nOf moments frozen in the past.\nI catch them on my outstretched hand,\nKnowing nothing here can last."

    title: "Quiet Streets",
    author: "Liam Winters",
    text: "The lampposts stand like sentinels,\nAlong the snow-packed empty street.\nTheir gentle glow on powdered white,\nMakes shadows dance around my feet.\n\nNo sound disrupts this perfect peace,\nNo footprints mar the pristine ground.\nThe city sleeps beneath the snow,\nIn winter's silence, dreams abound."

    title: "Ice Crystals",
    author: "Eliza North",
    text: "Like memories etched on frosted glass,\nThese patterns speak of nature's art.\nEach crystal formed with perfect grace,\nReminds me of your gentle heart.\n\nI trace the lines with fingertips,\nAnd watch as warmth dissolves their form.\nJust as your touch once melted me,\nBefore the coming of the storm."

    title: "Winter Silence",
    author: "Theo Morgan",
    text: "How softly falls the winter snow,\nEach flake a whisper from the sky.\nThe world now muted, hushed and still,\nAs clouds embrace the sun goodbye.\n\nIn silence deep as ancient seas,\nI walk alone through drifted white.\nMy thoughts the only company,\nIn this cathedral built of light."

    title: "February Dawn",
    author: "Isabel Frost",
    text: "The morning breaks in shades of grey,\nAs winter holds its fading reign.\nThe promise of a distant spring,\nStill buried under snow and rain.\n\nI rise to meet another day,\nMy breath a cloud that quickly fades.\nThe sunrise paints the eastern sky,\nWith hopeful pinks and gentle shades."

    title: "Snow Angels",
    author: "Mason Lee",
    text: "We fell like children to the ground,\nOur laughter rising to the stars.\nWith arms outstretched in frozen joy,\nWe left our marks, now yours and ours.\n\nTwo angels pressed in virgin snow,\nTheir wings spread wide as if in flight.\nA moment captured, soon to melt,\nWhen morning brings its warming light."

    title: "Frost Patterns",
    author: "Amelia Wright",
    text: "The window bears your artistry,\nIntricate patterns etched in frost.\nEach crystal branch, each icy fern,\nSpeaks of the warmth that we have lost.\n\nI trace the patterns with my gaze,\nThese temporary works of art.\nBy noon they'll fade from warming sun,\nJust as you've faded from my heart."

    id: 12,
    title: "Winter's Promise",
    author: "James River",
    text: "The shortest day, the longest night,\nWinter solstice marks the turn.\nThough darkness seems to dominate,\nThe sun's return we soon discern.\n\nThis season teaches patience well,\nAs life retreats beneath the snow.\nIn dormant seeds and sleeping trees,\nSpring waits its time, though none yet know."
